# Titanic Survival Prediction Analysis and Modeling

## Overview

This repository contains an analysis and predictive modeling of the Titanic dataset, aiming to predict the survival of passengers. The dataset includes information about passengers, with features such as class, age, sex, embarkation point, fare, and the target variable indicating whether a passenger survived or not.


## Dataset Description

The dataset consists of 891 entries with the following columns:

1. **PassengerID:** Unique identifier for each passenger.
2. **Pclass:** Passenger class (1st, 2nd, 3rd).
3. **Age:** Age of the passenger.
4. **Sex:** Gender of the passenger (male, female).
5. **SibSp:** Number of siblings/spouses aboard.
6. **Parch:** Number of parents/children aboard.
7. **Ticket:** Ticket number.
8. **Fare:** Fare paid for the ticket.
9. **Cabin:** Cabin number.
10. **Embarked:** Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).
11. **Survived:** Target variable (0 indicating not survived, 1 indicating survived).

## Usage

### Notebooks
